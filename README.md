## Installation

You should first install hugo on your local machine with `brew install hugo`
and then create a new repository with  and then in the ./themes you will put in
the theme as a submodule (do not clone it!)

This makes it easy to use a git submodule as a theme and to switch and update
as needed.

In general, to use a new theme copy the Theme's "new_site" directory to the
root and you can begin.
